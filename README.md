Here's the detail about how to run or get response from the API i just created:
 1. Run POSTMAN
 2. Type the following URL for each operation you need:
   localhost/api/disburse/getAll.php to get all records,
   localhost/api/disburse/getById.php to get single record by it's id as param,
   localhost/api/disburse/create.php to create new record,
   localhost/api/disburse/update.php to update record by it's id as input,
   localhost/api/disburse/delete.php to delete record by it's id as input,
Note: As this project is an open API, you can access it from any other clients as well.
